# Varrock Square

Varrock Square is a social blogging platform designed for the free-to-play [Old School RuneScape](https://oldschool.runescape.com) community. It's the perfect tool if you want to write a guide for your fellow players, or simply keep a log of your daily progress. Perhaps you want to discuss potential updates to the game, attaching a poll for quick feedback? On Varrock Square, you can do all this and more!

The app could easily be repurposed for other community interests.
